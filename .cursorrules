# PROJECT CONTEXT
This is a recovery housing and behavioral health platform. Security and empathy are paramount.

# CODING STANDARDS
* Use Functional Components with TypeScript interfaces.
* Styling: Use Tailwind CSS. Avoid inline styles.
* Components: Use shadcn/ui as the base library but customize the radius to 0.5rem for a softer look.
* Accessibility: All <img> tags MUST have descriptive alt text. All interactive elements must be keyboard navigable.

# DESIGN SYSTEM (Trauma-Informed)
* Primary Color: Sage Green (#7C9A92) - represents healing.
* Secondary Color: Sand/Beige (#F5F1E8) - represents stability.
* Accent Color: Deep Navy (#2C3E50) - represents trust (use for text/buttons).
* Font: "Inter" for UI, "Merriweather" or "Playfair Display" for Headings (warm serif).

# BANNED PATTERNS
* Do not use "Dashboard" layouts on the landing page.
* Do not display code snippets, API keys, or "system status" maps on the landing page.
* Do not use "skeleton loaders" that flicker; use smooth fade-ins.
