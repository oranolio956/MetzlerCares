## What Drives Speed

- Crawlability: server-rendered pages, clean sitemap/robots, correct canonicals, consistent URL patterns.
- Authority: local citations, Google Business profiles, trusted backlinks, brand mentions.
- Relevance: city-specific pages that satisfy intent (cost, scholarships, rules, local services).
- Quality/E‑E‑A‑T: real references, testimonials, partners; no unverified claims; clear NAP.
- Performance: strong Core Web Vitals (LCP/CLS), optimized assets, minimal JS.
- Internal linking: dense cross-links between city pages, scholarship hub, FAQ hub, and homepage.

## Realistic Timeline

- Indexing: hours–3 days after sitemap submission and Search Console “Request Indexing”.
- Long‑tail (e.g., “affordable sober living {city}”): 3–10 days if content is unique and relevant.
- Mid‑tail city intent (e.g., “sober living {city}”): 2–6 weeks depending on competition and citations.
- Head terms (statewide queries): 6–12+ weeks; accelerated with high‑quality backlinks and PR.
- Local pack (GMB): 2–4 weeks post‑verification with consistent NAP and reviews.

## Aggressive (But High‑Quality) Plan

- Phase 1: Technical readiness
  - Ensure SSR for all SEO pages; head/meta/schema rendered server‑side; unified sitemap; minimal robots; correct canonicals.
  - Remove all randomness and unverified claims; verified JSON‑LD (WebPage, FAQ, LocalBusiness/Residence, BreadcrumbList).
  - CWV tuning: image optimization, font preloads, defer non‑critical JS.
- Phase 2: Content coverage
  - Generate city pages `/co/{city}/sober-living` with verified local services, costs, scholarships, meetings, county resources, emergency links.
  - Build Scholarship Hub and FAQ Hub with schema; cross‑link from all city pages and homepage.
  - Add testimonials/partners with references; explicit “last updated” stamps.
- Phase 3: Distribution & Authority
  - Publish Medium summaries with canonical links; no duplication.
  - Create/optimize Google Business profiles per city; consistent NAP; encourage real reviews.
  - Submit to local directories and recovery orgs; announce scholarships via local press/partners.
- Phase 4: Monitoring & iteration
  - Wire Google Search Console ingestion; remove any mocked analytics.
  - Weekly index coverage checks, schema validation, CWV monitoring; adjust internal links and content depth based on GSC queries.

## Success Criteria

- 95%+ index coverage of targeted pages within 2 weeks.
- Top‑10 for “sober living {major city}” within 4–8 weeks; long‑tail wins in 1–2 weeks.
- Valid schema on all pages; CWV green; rising impressions/CTR in GSC.

If you approve, I’ll implement Phases 1–2 immediately: upgrade the city pages to high‑quality, verified content (no spam), wire scholarship/FAQ hubs, unify sitemap/robots/canonicals, and set up GSC monitoring to accelerate ranking across all sober living keywords in Colorado.
