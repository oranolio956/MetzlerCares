# **A Comprehensive Directory of Substance Use Disorder and Recovery Resources in Colorado: A Systematic Review and Guide**

## **I. Navigating Colorado's Behavioral Health System: A Foundational Overview**

### **A. Introduction: Deconstructing the Query**

This report provides a systematic directory of substance use disorder (SUD) and recovery resources within the state of Colorado. The request for a single, comprehensive list of "every" sober living, rehab, detox, and Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meeting must be addressed by first clarifying the structure of Colorado's behavioral health landscape.  
These four resource types are not cataloged by a single entity. They represent distinct categories of care, support, and governance, each with its own oversight body and directory system.

1. **Detoxification (Acute Medical Services):** This involves medically supervised withdrawal management. It is a formal, licensed healthcare service designed for acute stabilization.  
2. **Rehabilitation (Clinical Treatment Services):** This category includes licensed clinical programs such as inpatient, residential, partial-hospitalization (PHP), and intensive outpatient (IOP) services.  
3. **Sober Living (Non-Clinical Residential Support):** This is a form of peer-supported, substance-free *housing*. These residences are *certified* (not licensed) as meeting specific safety and operational standards by a dedicated state association.  
4. **Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) (Community Peer Support):** This is a non-professional, free, and anonymous fellowship of peers. It is not a clinical service but a community resource, self-organized into regional "Intergroups" that manage local meeting lists.

No single, static "list" can accurately capture all these resources. Therefore, this report provides a comprehensive *directory of directories*, identifying the official, primary-source locators for each category. These official tools are supplemented by the most extensive, compiled static lists available from reliable sources, presented herein to fulfill the request for Name and Location data.

### **B. Critical Insight: Colorado's Regulatory Transition**

A critical, time-sensitive factor impacting this data is that the State of Colorado's behavioral health regulatory system is in a period of foundational transition.  
As of January 1, 2024, the newly formed Colorado Behavioral Health Administration (BHA) has assumed responsibility for licensing and oversight. This new structure is actively replacing the "legacy" licensing system, which included "Substance Use Disorder (SUD) treatment licenses," "Community Mental Health Center (CMHC) designations," and "Community Mental Health clinic (CMHc) designations".  
This "legacy" system is being replaced by a new, unified "Behavioral Health Entity (BHE)" licensing structure. This is described as a "rolling transition" designed to support a wide range of providers with varied circumstances.  
The direct implication of this statewide regulatory reform is that any static list of *licensed* providers (i.e., detox and rehab facilities) is uniquely volatile. A provider's name, official designation, or licensed status may be subject to change as they transition to the new BHE structure.  
Consequently, for ensuring accuracy and patient safety, the use of official, state-managed *dynamic search tools* is not merely a convenience—it is a necessity. The static lists provided in this report serve as a comprehensive starting point, but all licensed clinical services must be verified using the primary source tools identified in the following section.

## **II. Directory of Licensed Clinical Treatment: Rehabilitation and Detoxification Facilities**

This section details the resources for identifying licensed clinical services, including medical detoxification, inpatient rehab, and outpatient treatment programs.

### **A. Official State and Federal Verification Tools (The Primary Sources)**

Given the regulatory transition in Colorado , these official locators are the primary source of truth for licensure and operational status. They are designed as dynamic search tools, not static, browsable lists.

#### **1\. Federal Locator: SAMHSA's FindTreatment.gov**

The U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) operates FindTreatment.gov, the official national locator for mental health and substance use disorder treatment. It is a confidential and anonymous resource for individuals seeking treatment. This tool is a key part of the federal government's help-seeking infrastructure.  
This resource functions as a secure search tool, not a public list. Attempts to extract a comprehensive, static "list of medical detox facilities in Colorado" from the tool are not supported by its design. Such queries return: "The information you have requested is unavailable in the document". The tool is built for users to "search for a treatment facility" based on their specific needs , ensuring a confidential, one-to-one query.

#### **2\. State Locator: Colorado BHA's OwnPath Care Directory (ownpath.co)**

At the state level, the Colorado Behavioral Health Administration (BHA) launched the **OwnPath Care Directory** as the official, accessible, and transparent resource for Coloradans seeking behavioral health care. It is the state's primary tool for navigating the new BHE landscape.  
OwnPath is a "search tool connected to a public list of licensed providers". It is a "searchable online directory" that allows users to find BHA-licensed entities and filter by specific criteria, including location, services, language support, and payment types accepted. Users are typically prompted to "Enter your zip code" to begin a search.  
Similar to the federal tool, OwnPath is not designed to provide a single, exhaustive "list." Research attempts to extract a "directory of licensed substance use disorder treatment providers" or a "directory of licensed detox facilities" from the public-facing site were unsuccessful, returning "The information you have requested is unavailable." This confirms its function as a guided search tool, intended to connect individuals to appropriate care based on specific needs rather than presenting a decontextualized master list.

### **B. Compiled Directory of Colorado Treatment Centers (Commercial & Third-Party Lists)**

The following tables provide an extensive, static list of providers identified as offering rehab or detox services in Colorado. This data is compiled from large, commercial, third-party directories.  
**Disclaimer:** These directories, such as Rehabs.com and Psychology Today , are often marketing platforms. A provider's inclusion, or "featured" status, may be part of a paid marketing strategy. These lists are a valuable starting point for identifying provider names but do not constitute an endorsement. All provider licensure and service claims must be verified using the BHA OwnPath tool or the SAMHSA FindTreatment.gov locator.

## **III. Directory of Certified Recovery Residences (Sober Living)**

This section addresses sober living, which is distinct from clinical treatment. Sober living homes provide a substance-free, peer-supported *living environment* for individuals in recovery.

### **A. The Certifying Body: Colorado Association of Recovery Residences (CARR)**

In Colorado, sober living homes are not *licensed* as medical facilities by the BHA. Instead, they are *certified* by an independent association. The primary certifying body is the **Colorado Association of Recovery Residences (CARR)**.  
CARR is the state affiliate of the National Association of Recovery Residences (NARR) and was created to bring national best practices and standards to sober living in Colorado. CARR certification is a voluntary process that signifies a residence has met state-level standards (per House Bill 19-2009), passed a physical inspection, and adheres to a code of ethics. CARR maintains a grievance and compliance process, including the revocation of certification for non-compliant programs.  
Using the official CARR directory is the most effective method for identifying a safe, structured, and accountable recovery residence, as certification "reflects a state-wide commitment to ethical, inclusive recovery housing".  
It should be noted that some publicly-funded residences may be affiliated with other recognized entities, including **Oxford House** (a national community-based model), **Sobriety House**, or **Step Denver**.  
Separately, the Colorado Department of Human Services (CDHS) operates a small, fixed number of **Mental Health Transitional Living Homes** in specific locations, such as three homes in Colorado Springs, three in Lakewood, two in Northglenn, two in Denver, and two in Pueblo West.

### **B. Comprehensive List of CARR-Certified Residence Organizations**

The official CARR directory is structured as a list of *certified organizations*, which may operate multiple individual residences across various cities. To find an available bed, an individual must contact the central organization.  
The following table is a comprehensive list of all CARR-certified recovery residence organizations in Colorado, along with the cities where they operate certified residences.

## **IV. Directory of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) Meetings**

This section provides a directory for Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings.

### **A. Understanding the AA Structure in Colorado**

Alcoholics Anonymous is not a commercial or clinical entity; it is a "fellowship of people who share their experience, strength and hope with each other that they may solve their common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism".  
AA is decentralized and anonymous. Meeting lists are managed locally by volunteer-run "Central Offices" or "Intergroups". These Intergroups provide services for the individual AA groups in their geographic area, such as managing a central office, maintaining a 24-hour hotline, and publishing the *official meeting directory*.  
Because meeting schedules are highly dynamic—with meetings added, moved, or canceled daily—any static list will become outdated. The *only* source of truth for a meeting's time and location is the official directory maintained by the local Intergroup.  
**Critical Warning on Unofficial Directories:** Generic, third-party AA meeting locator websites (e.g., aa-meetings.com, addictionresource.com) are often unreliable and may contain severe errors. For example, research on the site aa-meetings.com for "AA meetings Denver" returned results for "Denver, *North Carolina*". For an individual in crisis, such misinformation can be a dangerous barrier to help. It is strongly advised to *only* use the official Intergroup websites listed in Table 4.1.

### **B. Official AA Meeting Directories (The Primary Sources)**

The single most important resource for finding an AA meeting in Colorado is the website of the local Intergroup. The following table provides the official contact information and directory links for the primary AA Central Offices in Colorado.

#### **Table 4.1: Official Colorado AA Intergroup Meeting Directories**

## **V. Strategic Search and Verification Guide (Google Keyword Strategy)**

This section provides an actionable methodology for searching for and verifying recovery resources, addressing the request for "Google search keywords" that make a provider "pop up." This is best understood as a multi-step process for identification and verification.

### **A. Keywords for Finding Primary Sources (Finding the "List of Lists")**

The most effective first step is to locate the official directories.

* "Colorado Behavioral Health Administration provider directory"  
* "BHA OwnPa\[span\_88\](start\_span)\[span\_88\](end\_span)th Colorado search"  
* "SAMHSA Fi\[span\_89\](start\_span)\[span\_89\](end\_span)\[span\_90\](start\_span)\[span\_90\](end\_span)ndTreatment.gov"  
* "Colorado Association of Recovery Residences CARR"  
* "CARR certified recovery residences list"  
* "Denver AA Central Office meetings"  
* "Colorado \[span\_91\](start\_span)\[span\_91\](end\_span)\[span\_92\](start\_span)\[span\_92\](end\_span)Springs AA Intergrou\[span\_55\](start\_span)\[span\_55\](end\_span)\[span\_57\](start\_span)\[span\_57\](end\_span)p meetings"  
* "Northern \[span\_63\](start\_span)\[span\_63\](end\_span)\[span\_93\](start\_span)\[span\_93\](end\_span)\[span\_94\](start\_span)\[span\_94\](end\_span)\[span\_95\](start\_span)\[span\_95\](end\_span)Colorado AA Fort Collins"\[span\_22\](start\_span)\[span\_22\](end\_span)  
* "Boulder County AA meetings"  
* "Western C\[span\_96\](start\_span)\[span\_96\](end\_span)\[span\_97\](start\_span)\[span\_97\](end\_span)olorado AA Grand Junction"

### **B. Keywords for Verifying a Specific Provider (Verification Workflow)**

Once a provider's name is known (e.g., "Mile High Recovery Center" or "Zen Mountain Sober Living"), this workflow can be used to verify its credentials and reputation.

1. **Check State Licensure (Clinical):** Search the provider's name on the **BHA OwnPath** directory. A parallel Google search can be:  
   * "\[Facility Name\]" \+ "BHA license"  
   * "\[Facility Name\]" \+ "Colorado OwnPath"  
2. **Check State Certification (Sober Living):** Search the provider's name on the **CARR directory**. A parallel Google search can be:  
   * "" \+ "CARR certified"  
   * "" \+ "Colorado Association of Recovery Residences"  
3. **Check National Registration:** Search the provider's name on **SAMHSA's FindTreatment.gov**. This verifies if the facility is registered in the national database.  
   * "\[Facility Name\]" \+ "SAMHSA"  
4. **Check Commercial Directory Listing (Reputation):** Check for listings on major commercial directories. While these are marketing-focused, they often aggregate user reviews and detailed program descriptions.  
   * "\[Facility Name\]" \+ "Psychology Today"  
   * "\[Facility Name\]" \+ "Rehabs.com"  
5. **Check Community Feedback (Due Diligence):**  
   * "\[Facility Name\]" \+ "reviews"  
   * "\[Facility Name\]" \+ "complaints"  
   * "\[Facility Name\]" \+ "news"

### **C. Keywords for Locating by Specific Level of Care**

For users who do not have a specific facility name but know the *service* required, these search strings can be combined with a city name.

* "medical detox Denver"  
* "Colorado \[span\_98\](start\_span)\[span\_98\](end\_span)detox facilities"  
* "inpatient\[span\_99\](start\_span)\[span\_99\](end\_span)\[span\_100\](start\_span)\[span\_100\](end\_span) rehab Colorado Springs"  
* "residential treatment Fort Collins"  
* "intensive outpatient program (IOP) Aurora"  
* "Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP) Lakewood"  
* "certified sober living Boulder"  
* "CARR certified housing Arvada"  
* "Oxford House Denver"  
* "AA meetin\[span\_101\](start\_span)\[span\_101\](end\_span)gs near me" (Use this to find your *local Intergroup* from Table 4.1, not a third-party site).  
* "AA meetings \[City Name\]" (e.g., "AA meetings Pueblo" , "AA meetings \[span\_103\](start\_span)\[span\_103\](end\_span)Arvada" ).
